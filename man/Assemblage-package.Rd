\title{Assemblage: Assemblage Regression}
\description{
The concept of assemblage originates from the research paper titled "Maximally Forward-Looking Core Inflation" (2024) authored by Philippe Goulet Coulombe, Karin Klieber, Christophe Barrette, and Maximilian GÃ¶bel. Assemblage Regression represents a specialized form of generalized nonnegative ridge regression, designed to optimize the weights of subcomponents to maximize the predictive capability of the aggregate.
